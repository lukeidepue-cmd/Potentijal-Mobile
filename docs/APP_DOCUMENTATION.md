# Full App Documentation

Hello Cursor, as you know we were working on the backend for my App. We ran into a lot of issues so we decided to pivot and now we are going to have CURSOR AI code the backend of the app for us. What I need YOU to do is make a ROADMAP that covers EVERY DETAIL of my FULL app Documentation below. This roadmap is for cursor to follow and understand what I want for the backend and a lot of the frontend of this app, which is of course ALL below in my detailed documentation. Cursor AI can literally SEE and EDIT all of my code. So make sure you know that when making this. Don’t have cursor start the app from scratch or anything like that or provide unnecessary steps, because they can see my ALL of my code. Make sure to go into these roadmap steps in GREAT DETAIL so cursor knows EXACTLY what to do. I put a lot of effort into this documentation so I expect great effort back on this roadmap. Cursor should have very minimal questions because you need to provide it EVERY single DETAIL on what to do to achieve these documentations. ALSO remember that I have built a LOT of what is in these documentations, so make SURE it is CLEAR to cursor to only build stuff that I do NOT already have, and they can see my code so it shouldn’t be a problem. But that is why you need to be clear and detailed so that cursor doesn’t build what I already have because a lot of this documentation contains what I already have, since this is a documentation of the ENTIRE app and I have of course built some of the app. In this roadmap for cursor I need you to break it down into STEPS and in each step I want you to give the details to cursor in CODE FORM AND in PLAIN ENGLISH. So you are telling cursor what to do for each step in coding terms and in plain english all ACCORDING to my documentations. Finally, make SURE cursor knows that we need to do a functionality check very FREQUENTLY, probably after each step, to make SURE that step is working, make sure you also implement that into the Roadmap.

INTRODUCTION:

Welcome to the Documentation for my app. This documentation is going to include the frontend and backend features for every aspect in the app. I will divide this documentation up into sections so it is easier to understand. I will do my best to explicitly state what I want, but I also trust that you can logically piece together how a lot of what I describe should work. Also I describe each tab in order of section from top to bottom for the most part if that matters. Ok let’s get into it.

App Purpose: Before we can get into the technical descriptions, I want to go over the app purpose so you know the goal and direction and mind when we are building all of this.
The purpose of this app is for ANY kind of athlete to be able to Track and See their progress in their athletic endeavor. Millions of athletes around the world dream of getting better, so in order to get better they practice and train for their sport. The thing is, making Progress in Sports is extremely hard to measure. How can the athlete have confidence that they are improving? That is where our app will come in, giving athletes the tool to see their progress by tracking it through our app. The app will also come with a ton of tiny little tools like the Macro Tracking, AI Coach, copying workouts, that will make this app go above and beyond in being the best app for athletes on the app store. Essentially the main purpose of our app is for athletes to be able to see their progress, but along with that many tools to help them see more of their progress and help aid the athlete in making that progress.

Here is an important detail about this documentation that you will need to really pay attention to. I am breaking up this documentation into sections, and for each section I am going to do 2 things. I am NOT going to fully go into what exact backends and buttons I want, and I am going to mention features that we have not built yet. So EVERY section in this documentation will have these specification + context areas within:



Backend Features that I didn’t explicitly mention but of course need to be here:

Under here I will quickly mention the backend features I don’t explicitly mention, but that obviously need to be communicated in the roadmap, for this section.

Context I Added but we have not Built Yet:

Under here I will try to mention everything I say that is frontend related that we have not built or set up yet. I will not mention backend things under here because we of course haven’t built any backend yet and you already know that.

Final Important Note: Cursor, you are really smart, and I am not as smart. So, there is going to be a TON of tiny gaps that I do not fill with my documentation. But since you are really smart I trust that you will be able to fill those gaps. For example, when I mention that the user can choose up to 2 sports in the sign up, you should automatically infer that those sports they choose will be the only ones their app has the modes to, even if I don’t tell you. Or if I tell you about the sign up process with apple or google, I shouldn’t have to tell you to create boxes for users to type their username and password, because obviously they need boxes to type their username and password in order to sign up. Essentially , YOU are the coder, you need to make sure that EVERYTHING possible gets coded. I am just giving you a detailed outline, but you need to fill in those obvious gaps because I can’t mention every single thing. Ok thank you, now let’s get started!




Section 1: Signing Up + Logging In

This documentation will go from Start to Finish of this App. Of course once someone downloads the app off the app store, the first thing they have to do is make an account.
So when they first click on the app they will be presented with the App Logo and then “Sign Up” and “Log In” buttons near the bottom. The “Sign Up” button will be above the “Log In” button and they will both stretch across most of the screen (without touching the sides of course). 
If the user presses “Log In” it will ask them for their email and password, and then there will also be a small button to go to the Sign Up section in case they accidentally realize they need to Sign Up.
If the user presses “Sign Up” then they will be prompted to either sign up with Apple (which would just be their password I think) or sign up with Google. If you think they should be able to sign up with anything else (if there is another common sign up option that I am forgetting) then please add it. There will also be a small “Log In” button here in case they realize they already have an account.

Once they Sign Up they will go through sort of an initiation process, so we know how to structure the app around this specific user. First they will be asked to create their account username, display name, and password. Then they can click a big arrow or button to go to the next screen.
Second they will be asked to select their sports, which will affect what Sport Modes they will have available in their app. They are allowed to select up to 2 Sports in this sign up process, and their options will of course be the ones we provide (Working Out, Running, Basketball, Football, Baseball, Soccer, Hockey, Tennis).
Once they choose their sports, they can click a button or arrow to go to the next screen. This next screen will have another logo and ask the user if they want to sign up for premium. The user can choose to purchase premium, and there will also be a box on that screen where the user can type a creator code to get a 20% off discount on premium. If they type in a valid code the box should turn green indicating that the code was valid. If they push the button to purchase premium, they should be taken to a new screen where they can add their form of payment and buy premium, and if they entered a valid creator code, premium should be shown to be 20% off for the user, and actually cost 20% less of course.
Or the user can just click to go to the next screen without buying premium.

Once they pass this premium screen they will be taken into the App Home screen for whatever sport mode they selected First.




Backend Features that I didn’t explicitly mention but of course need to be here:

Of course we need the backend function of account creation, signing up with apple and google, and maybe more, logging into accounts. Make sure each account is unique and there are no repeat usernames. Make sure payment can work and the 20% discount can work with a proper code. Make sure the sports the user picks are the only ones they have when they get into the app. There is some more obvious stuff that needs to be built, but I think I got my point across with the documentation.

Context I Added but we have not Built Yet:

So of course we have not built ANY screens for the sign up, that definitely is something big that hasn’t been built. Also I mention a creator code, I will explain more on that later, but yes that is also something we will have to build. 
I think it would be a good idea to add Sign Up frontend as one of the last things in the roadmap, so I can easily see our changes to the main part of the app easily, then focus on tying everything together with the sign up screens near the end. Also I do not have any payment code or any Stripe stuff setup, nor am I in the position to do so at the moment, so in the roadmap I really need you to emphasize that we need the payment built but label it as a DO LATER and we can do other code around it first until I am in the position to add Stripe.




SECTION 2: THE HOME TAB

This is the FIRST Tab of Five located to the Left of the Tab Bar on the bottom of the Screen. This tab is DEPENDENT on what “Sport Mode” the app is in. So if in the sign up the user selected basketball and lifting, those are the only 2 sport modes their app can be in. They can change their sport mode with a button in the top right that is next to the settings button. This sport mode button will give a drop down of their chosen 1-2 sports, which they can switch between, which will change what sport mode the app is in. The functions in the Home Tab depend on what sport mode the app is in, so I will detail each Home Tab’s frontend and backend functions below for each sport mode, which consist of workout mode, basketball mode, football mode, running mode, baseball mode, hockey mode, soccer mode, and tennis mode.


Home Tab for Workout Mode:
 
Ok this mode has 3 big sections that I will detail. The first is the Weekly Schedule. This section displays 7 lines (representing the 7 days of the week) with boxes on the left of the lines. Each line will either have no text, or text above it. To the right of each line is also the date in the format month/day, like “11/9” for example. There will be text above the line if the user added it using the second big section in this page, which is the “+Schedule Week” button. When the user presses this button they will be taken to another screen (which has not been built yet) where they can type whatever they want for each day of the current week, and next week. They can also press this button to go back to this screen and edit what they have in the current week and next week, whenever they want. They will likely type their workout schedule and what workout they are doing each day. If the user LOGS a Workout on a Day where they typed something. So let’s say they added text for 11/9. If the user logs a workout that day, then the box next to that line and text will get a Check Mark and the line will turn green. If they do not log a workout on a day where they added text, then they get an X in the box and the line will turn red. When I say text I assume the user typed their workout for that day like “leg day” so if they log a workout that day, they will get a check mark because they completed their workout. The ONLY times where the user gets a check mark when they do not log a workout is when the leave the line blank (so they didn’t schedule anything for that day) or if they typed “Rest” or “Rest Day” or something like that, so if they didn’t work out, they get a check mark for their rest day. Please make sure we sense fuzzy text that is similar to “rest” so we can give a check mark if the user types anything close to “rest”.

The third big section in this Workout Mode Home Tab is the Progress Graph. This is one of the most important things in the entire app, and it is very complex, so I will explain it in as much detail as possible. Let’s break this progress graph down, it has a title, text box, two buttons that drop down more buttons, and then a graph with an x-axis and a y-axis.
Let’s break down the drop down buttons first. The drop down on the left reveals these options to change the drop down to: “Reps”, “Weight” and “Reps x Weight”. This left drop down will be DIFFERENT depending on what sport mode the app is in. This left drop down connects to and changes the Y-AXIS of the graph.
The second drop down to the right of that one reveals these options the user can select for this drop down, “7 Days”, “30 Days”, “90 Days”, “180 Days”, and “360 Days”. This drop down with these options will be the SAME for every sport mode. This drop down connects to and changes the X-AXIS of the graph. Here is how this X-axis is going to work, each number of days selected shows a different number of points on the X-axis. “7 Days” shows 7 points, one for each day in the past 7 days. “30 Days” shows 4 points on the X-axis, each representing 7 days of time. So the first x axis point would be 30-21 days ago, the 2nd would be 21-14 days ago, the third would be 14-7 days ago, and the last would be the last 7 days. So the last 30 days is divided into 4 equal time intervals represented in the X axis. For “90 Days” there will be 6 X axis points, each one for a 15 day period, that follows the same format as the 30 and 7 day formats where each point goes another time interval (15 days each for “90 Days”) into the past if the x axis is read right to left. “180 Days” has 6 time intervals, one for each 30 day period in the past 180 days. Finally “360 Days” has 6 x axis points, each one representing a 60 day time interval in the past 360 days, and these 60 day periods should get closer and closer to the present, if the X-axis is read from left to right.
So we know that whatever is selected in this drop downs impacts the graph, but for them to impact the graph we need something in the TEXT BOX. The text box shows the preview text “Search an Exercise (e.g. bench press)...”. This shows the user to type an exercise that they do in this text box.
Ok, now let’s get into how this graph will work now that you know how it connects a little. I will start off explaining with an example, because I think that will make it easier to understand. Let’s say the user types “Bench Press” and they select “Reps x Weight” and “30 Days”. The graph’s purpose is to show the progression or regression of the user’s reps x weight of bench press over the last 30 days, but how does the graph do this? Well, the graph needs to first find ALL of the LOGGED Sets and Reps and Weight of “Bench Press” from the users Logged workouts in the last 30 days. (workouts are explained in Section 3). 
Let’s say this is the users bench press data over the past 30 days:
Last 30 days: Set 1: 30 ILBS, 10 reps, Set 2: 35ILBs, 8 reps, Set 3, 40ILBS 3 reps
Last 21 days: Set 1: 40ILBS 3 reps, Set 2: 40ILBS 5 reps, Set 3: 40ILBS 5 reps
Last 14 Days: Set 1: 40ILBS 7 reps, Set 2: 40ILBS 8 reps, Set 3: 45ILBS 2 reps
Last 7 Days: Set 1: 45ILBS 3 reps, Set 2: 45ILBS 4 reps, Set 3: 45ILBS 4 reps

As we can see he has logged 3 sets of bench press each week over the past 30 days, and he has progressed in his Reps x Weight. We know that 30 Days makes the X-axis have 4 points, one for each week in the past 30 days. And we know the Y axis shows the Reps x Weight. So there would be one point on each X-axis point matching the Reps x Weight of his bench press for that week. To get his “Reps x Weight” each week we would take his AVERAGE of all of the Sets in that time period. So for the first X axis point (30 days ago) it would show (30x10 + 35x8 + 40x3) / 3 = 233.33 (round everything to a whole number please) so 233 would be his Y axis value because that was the average Reps x Weight for bench press in that 1 week interval point, which is the first point on the X axis. So the point displayed on the graph would be above the first X axis point and then next to “233” on the Y axis. Each point should be leveled matching their “reps x weight” on the y axis. I am making this up, but let’s say the final week in this 30 day period had an average of 270 reps x weight. Then that point would be ABOVE the point in the first week, because 270 is greater than 233. You only need to display the points on the y axis for every X axis point assuming the user logged a set of this exercise in that time interval. So if we have 30 Days selected and the user did at leats 1 set of bench press every time interval (every 7 days), then there would be 4 y axis points and the y axis should be displayed from least at the lowest point to the greatest reps x weight as the highest point on the graph. The other 3 points would follow the same formula. If the user did 6 sets in that first week, then we would STILL take the average reps x weight for the time interval and that would be the Y axis value.
This formula applies to every time interval and for “reps” or “weight”. If we have “Reps” and “360 Days”, then each X axis point (6 of them, which are each a 60 day time interval) will represent the average number of reps the user did for “bench press” in that 60 day period per set.
Maybe the user was lifting a lot of weight 180 days ago, but then in the past 60 days their weight went down. Well then if “180 Days” and “weight” is selected, the graph would maybe look upward sloping and then downward sloping in the last 2 x axis points according to our formula. 
And of course the user should be able to search for any exercise they have logged before.
Now let’s say the user is looking at the last 7 Days and they only did “bench press” on one of the days. Then the graph should just show that one point, and the rest of the x axis points will just not have a point displayed. This can work for any exercise. Let’s say the user doesn’t frequently do push ups, but they did 3 sets of push ups 120 days ago, and 3 sets of push ups 180 days ago, and didn’t do push ups any time of the year. The user can search for push ups, and nothing should show up when “7 Days”, “30 Days”, or “90 Days” is selected, because the user did not Log ANY push ups in their workouts in the past 90 days. But let’s say the user selects “360 Days”, the 2nd x axis point and the 3 x axis point will have a point displayed on the graph, because the user logged “push ups” in those months, but the other x axis points will not get a point displayed on the graph, because push ups were not logged in that time interval.
To clarify, users NAME their exercises in the Workouts Tab. so they can name an exercise “bench press” and then log SETS of reps and weight under that exercise. So when a user searches for “bench press”, the graph should be pulling DATA from all sets UNDER exercises named “bench press” in the given time interval.
I need you to make these exercises in the search bar FUZZY, or account for fuzziness, I might not be using the term “fuzy” right but I’ll explain what I want. Let’s say the user always named their bench press exercises “Bench Press” or “Bench”. When they search “bench press” (lowercase) or “Bench press” (one uppercase, one lowercase” the data still needs to pull data from exercises named “Bench Press” or “Bench”. So uppercase and lowercase, or slight misspelling CANNOT get in the way of the data being pulled to be displayed on the graph.

Hopefully I explained the graph ok. This SAME Formula works for the graph in ALL of the other Sport Mode Home Pages. The ONLY thing that changes between sport mode is the left drop down options. So like in basketball mode for example, the left drop down will NOT show options to see “Reps”, “Weight” and “Reps x Weight” but instead something else that I will detail with each sport mode below.


Home Tab for Basketball Mode:

Ok, this Mode’s Home Tab has 5 big sections that I will detail. First is the Weekly Goals display. This Weekly Goals section displayed a box with a weekly goal on it. The user should be able to swipe to another box if they have created more than one weekly goal. The user creates weekly goals with the “+Add Weekly Goal” button. When they click this the user should be taken to a new screen (not created yet) where they can enter the name of their weekly goal, and then a goal number, which will be the number of that certain goal they want to hit. For example they could type “3 pointers made” for the name and “100” for the number. Then on the weekly goals section the box would display the Goal Name, and the number they assigned to their goal under 0 like “0/100”. Here is the complicated part of this section. Whenever the user logs something that is connected to their goal, I want that goal to update. So let’s say the user creates a workout, names an exercise “ 3 pointers” or “3 point shot” and they log 20 made and 40 attempted. Well then the box with the “3 pointers made” goal should update from 0/100 to 20/100. Also there is a BAR under each goal, and that bar should update from 0% filled to 20% filled. That is just for 1 goal, they could add multiple goals and swipe through them and all of them should update if they log completed reps of that goal. Again, I need this to be really FUZZY. If their goal is “2 pointers made” and they create an exercise called “2 pointers” (lowercase and no “made”) or “2 Pointers Made” (both uppercase), and a lot more different variations of spelling or uppercase vs. lowercase then I want the goal to still be able to tell that they are tracking for something related to 2 points, and therefore their goal number should increase.

Next is the progress graph. And here I am going to make a very important explanation that is also explained in the workout tab, but I also want to explain it here. So I already explained the Workout Mode Progress graph to you, as you know the left drop down (the one that changes between modes) has “Reps”, “Weight”, and “Reps x Weight” as the selection options. Well in the WORKOUT TAB for Workout Mode, there is only ONE type of exercise you can select, it is called “exercise”, and in these exercise types, you can track Reps and Weight. Well in basketball mode you can actually add THREE different exercise types. One type is “exercise” like the one in Workout Mode it tracks reps and weight. The 2nd the user can add is the “Shooting” type, where instead of the set asking for reps and weight, it asks for “Attempted” and “Made”. The last type they can add to their workout is the “Drill Type” where they input their “Reps” and “Time (min)” (this (min) is actually in the name of “Time (min) showing the user that they should input their time in minutes). 
So with the basketball mode there are 3 types of exercises the user can track in any given workout. They can track their shot with “shooting” or track a “drill”. These obviously have different input names than “reps” and “weight” so the user can track a wider variety of things depending on their sport.
Now that you know that the user can track different types of exercise with different input names, we can get into the graph for sport modes. As we know the right drop down (the one with the days) stays the same, but the left value is going to be different. The options the user can select for the left drop down menu DEPEND on what exercise they search in the search bar. Let’s work through this explanation with a couple examples.
Let’s say the user searches for “3 Point Shot” in the search bar. First the app needs to see under what exercise type “3 Point Shot” has been most commonly tracked under. Let’s say the user primarily named “Shooting” type exercise “3 point shot”. Well then the options for the left drop down would be “Attempted” “Made” and “Percentage” because those are the input names for a “Shooting” type exercise NOT “reps” and “weight”. So when the app knows that the exercise they searched is tracked primarily under a “Shooting” type exercise, then the left drop down gives selections for the input names tracked in a “Shooting” type exercise, which are of course “Attempted” and “Made”. This goes for every type of exercise, if the user primarily tracks “Pull ups” under “Exercise” type exercises in their workouts, then the left drop down options the user can select for the graph will be “Reps”, “Weight”, and “Reps x Weight” since that is what the input areas are for “Exercise” type exercises.
Now, I know that “Exercise” type exercises only track “Reps” and “Weight” but I want you to also add in the “Reps x Weight” option, so exactly what options should you add for each exercise type in every sport mode? Don’t worry, I’ll specify exactly what options I want for every type of exercise in each sport mode.
So to summarize, when a user searches an exercise, the app first has to see what TYPE of exercise that “name” is tracked under, then it will display the options for that exercise type, and then the user can view the graph with the 2 dropdowns that work in the exact same formula as the Workout Mode graph that I described earlier (above). This will make even more sense when you read Section 3, the Workout Tab section, so please read everything before you start making the roadmap.

The next section in this Basketball Mode Home Tab is the Log Game section. The user can click the “+Add Game” button and be taken to a new screen where they can type the Date, their Stats, choose the game outcome with buttons, and add additional notes in the final textbox. When they press “Save” this information for this game should be SAVED, and the user should be able to view it in the History Tab, which I’ll explain in a later section. This section also has a picture of a professional basketball athlete attached to it for visual purposes.

The final section is pretty similar to the Log Game section, it is the Log Team Practice Section. This section also has a picture of a pro basketball athlete. The user can click “+Add Practice” and be taken to a new screen where they can type the Date, Drill, and additional Notes into text boxes. When they press the “Save” button this practice should be SAVED and be able to be viewed in the History Tab which I will go into detail of in a later section of this documentation.

The exercise TYPES for basketball mode are “Exercise” which let’s users input “Reps” and “Weight”, the next type is “Shooting” where users input “Attempted”, “Made” and their percentage is shown, the last type is “Drill” where users input their “Reps” and “Time (min)”
For the progress graph, if an exercise is primarily tracked with an “Exercise” type exercise (meaning the name the put in the search bar is matching or closely matching a name that they use with “Exercise” TYPE exercises) then the left drop down options should be “Reps”, “Weight”, and “Reps x Weight”. If an exercise if primarily tracked with a “Shooting” type exercise, then the left drop down options should be “Attempted”, “Made”, and “Percentage”, and this data should be able to be pulled from these values that are logged under these shooting type exercises. Finally, if an exercise is primarily tracked with a “Drill” type exercise, then the left drop down options should be “Reps” and “Time (min)”. Remember, you are getting the values you display on the graph from the LOGGED values that the user put under these names, and then you are displaying within time intervals that the user picks with the right drop down.


Home Tab for Football Mode:

Ok, the rest of the Sport Modes (Football, Baseball, Soccer, Hockey, Tennis, NOT Running) will follow almost the exact same format of the Basketball Mode. The ONLY differences are the Pro Athlete pictures and the Left Drop Down options on the progress graph, because obviously different things get tracked in the different Sport’s workout modes. So now for each mode documentation for the home tab I will detail every exercise TYPE for each Sport Mode, then explain the drop down options if an exercise searched is tracked in that exercise type. So that means I need EVERYTHING in these next 5 modes (this one included) to be the EXACT same except for the left drop down and pictures. That means the weekly goals functions, Log game, and Log practice functions.

In Football the exercise types the user can add to their workout are “Exercise” which users add their “Reps” and “Weight”, a “Drill” type where users input their “Reps” and “Completed”, and finally a “Sprints”  type where users input their “Reps”, “Distance”, and “Avg. Time (sec)” (this (sec) is actually included in the name of Avg. Time (sec), it indicates that the user should input their time for their sprints in seconds). If they search an exercise primarily tracked with “Exercise” type then the left drop down options are “Reps”, “Weight” and “Reps x Weight”. If they If they search an exercise primarily tracked with “Drill” then the left drop down options are “Reps” and Completed”. If they search an exercise primarily tracked with “Sprints” then the left drop down options are “Reps”, “Distance” and “Avg. Time (sec)”. Again all you need to do is pull these values from what the user logged under these names and then display accordingly to what options they select for the graph. 


Home Tab for Baseball Mode:

Like I said, the only 2 things that change are the athlete images, and the Workout exercise TYPES that the user can log their workouts with, and therefore see on the graph. In Baseball Mode you can add an “Exercise” type where they can input “Reps” and “Weight”. If they search an exercise primarily tracked with “Exercise” the the left drop down options are “Reps”, “Weight”, and “Reps x Weight”. The 2nd exercise TYPE is “Hitting”, where the user can input values under “Reps” and “Avg. Distance”. If they search an exercise primarily tracked with “Hitting” the left drop down options are “Reps” and “Avg. Distance”. The last exercise TYPE is “Fielding”, where the user can input values under “Reps” and “Distance”. If they search an exercise primarily tracked with “Fielding” the left drop down options are “Reps” and “Distance”.


Home Tab for Soccer Mode:

At this point I think you know the pattern we are following. Here are the TYPES of exercises the user can add in Soccer Mode. The first is the “Exercise” type where they can input “Reps” and “Weight”. If they search an exercise primarily tracked with “Exercise” the the left drop down options are “Reps”, “Weight”, and “Reps x Weight”. The 2nd is the “Drill” type where they can input “Reps” and “Time (min)”. If they search an exercise primarily tracked with “Drill” the the left drop down options are “Reps”, and “Time (min)”. The third is the “Shooting” type where they can input “Reps” and “Distance”. If they search an exercise primarily tracked with “Shooting” the the left drop down options are “Reps”, and “Distance”.

Home Tab for Hockey Mode:

Same thing as the other sport modes, here are the exercise types for the Hockey Mode home tab. The first is the “Exercise” type where they can input “Reps” and “Weight”. If they search an exercise primarily tracked with “Exercise” the the left drop down options are “Reps”, “Weight”, and “Reps x Weight”. The 2nd is the “Drill” type where they can input “Reps” and “Time (min)”. If they search an exercise primarily tracked with “Drill” the the left drop down options are “Reps”, and “Time (min)”. The third is the “Shooting” type where they can input “Reps” and “Distance”. If they search an exercise primarily tracked with “Shooting” the the left drop down options are “Reps”, and “Distance”.

Home Tab for Tennis Mode:

Ok this is the final Sport Mode, and it follows the same format as the rest, here is the exercise type information that is all you need. The first is the “Exercise” type where they can input “Reps” and “Weight”. If they search an exercise primarily tracked with “Exercise” the the left drop down options are “Reps”, “Weight”, and “Reps x Weight”. The 2nd is the “Drill” type where they can input “Reps” and “Time (min)”. If they search an exercise primarily tracked with “Drill” the the left drop down options are “Reps”, and “Time (min)”. The third is the “Rally” type where they can input “Points” and “Time (min)”. If they search an exercise primarily tracked with “Rally” the the left drop down options are “Points”, and “Time (min)”.

Home Tab for Running Mode:

Ok, this Home Tab for the running mode does NOT follow the same format as the rest of the other Modes. It does have some similarities with other modes however. 

This mode is going to have the same Schedule Section and “+Schedule Week” button function as the Workout Mode home page that will both function the exact same way. I already described how these sections function so I won’t need to again.

This mode will also have a progress graph that will function the same as all of the other ones. But the thing about running mode, is that it doesn’t have exercise types that users can log in their workouts. Instead the workout tab for this mode actually tracks users' runs. So for the left drop down on the graph the options will be “Distance (miles)” (and yes it should actually say (miles) so the user knows the measurement of their distance progress), “Avg. Pace (per mile) (again it should say (per mile)”, and “Time” because these 3 things will be tracked in the workout tab for this mode.

Final Clarification: I just wanted to clarify a couple more things in case they were not clear. The data displayed on a progress graph should ONLY be data and workout information from the MODE that the app is in for that progress graph. So if the user is looking at their progress graph in basketball mode, they should NOT be seeing information from Workouts logged in their Workout Mode, only information from workouts logged in BASKETBALL Mode. 
Remember, Workouts have named and then the exercise in that workout have a name. So when you are pulling information, make sure to pull according to the exercise TYPE, and then EXERCISE name, not workout name. Also literally if we are displaying something like “Avg. Time” all you have to do is get the Values that the USER input in the Avg. Time box for the specific square that the exercise name is primarily tracked with in the given time interval for THAT MODE, so you are not creating ANY numbers. ALL of the data displayed comes from what the USER LOGS!!!

Backend Features that I didn’t explicitly mention but of course need to be here:

OK! There is obviously a LOT, as this is our biggest Tab I think, so I will not be able to list them all. This tab needs to include tracking and saving of data from the workouts to display on the graphs, being able to quickly display information on the graph based on the data saved, being able to switch between modes and the data available for the graph will change. I know I said it a lot at the beginning of this section and not so much at the end, but make sure EVERYTHING with words is EXTREMELY FUZZY. There can be a LOT of variation with the things the user types and there is a LOT of connection relying on typing in this section. So make sure everything is EXTREMELY FUZZY and the app accounts for miss spellings, uppercase vs. lowercase, even like “3 point shot” and “3 point shooting”, should connect with each other, that's how wide I need this typing connection to be. Of course games and practices need to be able to be saved and viewed somewhere else for EVERY MODE. 

Context I Added but we have not Built Yet:

I have not built the screen for the “+Schedule Next Week” button in Workout Mode and the “+Add Weekly Goal” screens for all of the other 7 Sport Modes. Honestly we have built most of the frontend for this already, except for the Running Home tab, we have yet to build much of that the way I want it. And of course none of the backend is built for this yet.




SECTION 3: THE WORKOUT TAB:

This is the SECOND Tab of Five located to the Middle Left of the Tab Bar on the bottom of the Screen. This tab is DEPENDENT on what “Sport Mode” the app is in. So if in the sign up the user selected basketball and lifting, those are the only 2 sport modes their app can be in with this tab.

So I actually detailed a LOT of this tab’s functions in the Section Above, like what TYPES of exercise you can add to a workout in each sport mode, and then what kind of areas you can input values into within each of those types. I am NOT going to go over those again. Let’s get into the documentation for the workout tab detailing stuff I have not mentioned in detail yet. 

This Tab has a heading and when first entered there is a big green “+Add Workout” button. When this workout is clicked, there is a text box to type the Workout Name. Below that is the Exercise Type Boxes. So if the app was in Workout Mode, the only exercise Type Box would be “exercise” the user can click this and then a Box will appear below. If the app was in Basketball Moe there would be THREE exercise type boxes, “Exercise”, “Shooting”, and “Drill”. The user can click these boxes again and again and another box will appear below that. The user can add as many of these as they want, and then scroll down to see them all. Each of these boxes is of course for each exercise in their workout. So maybe the user does Pull Ups and then Shooting in their workout, they can add one “exercise” type box and one “shooting” type box. I already explained in section 2, all of the exercise types and then what you can track under each one. 

Each one of these boxes has a text box for the exercise name, which is important because that is what you’ll be seeing to pull information from when the user searches for exercises in their progress graph. Each box also has a small “Set+” button where they can add sets to their boxes. Each box automatically starts with 1 set already up, the user can add as many as they want to an exercise with this button. Inside these Sets is where the input areas are like for an “exercise” type box “Reps” and “Weight” text boxes are within each Set box. And this makes sense, the user can add 1 “exercise” hence the exercise box, and then they can track their reps and weight over 1-however many sets in their exercise. Same goes for every other exercise type and the input areas within the sets of those exercise types. And again the exercise types available depend on the sport mode the app is in.

Once the user is happy with all of the Values they have typed into their workout, they can click “Save Workout”, which is a button at the bottom of this screen that is sticky to the screen. This should take them to another screen (which is not built yet) where they can see the Workout Name, and then the names of every exercise under and how many sets were in each exercise of that workout, like their workout overview. From here they can click "Finish Workout” or click a back arrow in the top left that will take them back to their workout where they can continue to edit it and add sets and exercises. If they click “Finish Workout” then the workout should save to the database and should also be able to be viewed in the History Tab (we will get into this tab later), and the workout information should now also should be a part of the data that can impact the progress graph.



Backend Features that I didn’t explicitly mention but of course need to be here:

We will of course need saving of workouts to the database. The app needs to be able to see the values the user types for what sections of their workouts so that it can be displayed in the progress graph properly. Again, we need FUZZY word connection, the user will be naming exercises and workouts, so searches need to account for uppercase, lowercase, similar phrasing, and miss spelling, in a very WIDE Range, the more slight differences accounted for, the BETTER. So users will need to search for workouts in the History Tab, so make sure the Workout names account for just as much fuzziness. Make sure the app won’t crash if they add to many exercises or sets. I would really consider adding a limit on the amount of exercises and sets, but please make it high. Obviously we need connection between workouts and the home tab, for Weekly Goals and the progress graph.

Context I Added but we have not Built Yet:

I have built most of the frontend for this except for the screen after the user presses “Save Workout”. And of course no backend is built for this




SECTION 4: THE MEALS TAB:

This is the THIRD of 5 Tabs located in the MIDDLE of the 5 tabs on the bottom tab row. There are around 5-6 big sections in this tab and there are a LOT of screens. This tab does NOT change based on the mode the app is in, it is ALWAYS the same. 

The first thing on this page is simply just the date. I want a 3D looking display of the date, in a small size, centered, at the top of this tab. This will actually be a button that is CLICKABLE and when the user click this a menu to change the date by scrolling through numbers to pick the month date and year (like a birthday picker when signing up for something). With this the user can select any date. If they select a date that they did track macros on, the MEALS TAB should change to display their macros and everything they tracked THAT DAY. so all of the sections I detail below will change BACK to the day they are looking at, except for the Meals Progress Graph, that will stay the same no matter what date their tab is set to. This date menu thing is here so users can look at old days of their diet, recent or far away. If it makes it easier you can make the farthest date they can go back to the day they downloaded the app. If you let any day be displayed, and they choose a date that they didn’t have the app downloaded (like in 2019), then you can just display the tab for the current day. But I recommend that you make the earliest they can go back to the day they downloaded the app. We have not built this feature at all yet by the way, frontend or backend.

The first section is the “Scan Barcode” button. This button is the 2nd closest thing to the header at the top of the tab. When pressed this button takes the user to their camera (and asks for permission with allow vs. don’t allow) and there is a little green outline on their screen. This is where the user can put the barcode in their camera. There should be a back button on the camera screen to go back to the main meals tab (but that button isn’t built yet). There is also a camera flip button and a torch button that turns the flash on both in the top right of this screen.

Back on the main tab, the next section is the Add to Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, and Snanks. This section has 4 buttons top to bottom in the order “+Add to Breakfast”, “+Add to Lunch”, “+Add to Dinner”, and “+Add to Snacks”. When any of these buttons is pressed it takes the user to a new screen where they can search for any food. Once the Food API is set up, options for the food they are searching for should come up. When they click on a given food they are taken to a new screen which is an overview of the macros of the specific food or item that they clicked on. This overview tells them the item’s Calories, Protein, Carbs. Fat, Sugar, and Sodium, per serving. They can quickly edit the number of servings in a text box to whatever number of servings they want up to 999 servings. Under the Macros for that item there is a button that says “Add to [meal they clicked on first]” (it doesn’t actually say [meal they clicked on first] but let’s say they clicked “+Add to Breakfast” and got to this screen, then that button would say “+Add to Breakfast). If they decide to click this button on a food item, that food item will now be listed under the meal they added the food item under, and the user is taken back to the meals tab main screen. That food item will have the calories to the right of it on its row, and each meal displays the total calories tracked under that meal. So if I added a 100 calorie steak, and a 100 calorie apple under “Lunch” then to the right of “+Add to Lunch” it would say “200” in green, because there are 200 calories tracked under Lunch. Have ALL of these food items that are tracked become untracked at the start of each new day at midnight. So that means all of the calorie numbers next to the meals will go back to Zero

The next section is the burned calories section. Users can simply input a number in the text box and that will serve as their burned calories. So if the user has tracked 2000 calories, and they type 200 in the Burned Calories text box and press the “Save” button, their total calories should update to 1800. Their total calories (the number that changes) is in this next section. Have this number be reset to ZERO at the start of each new day at Midnight.

The next section is below everything else so far and it is the Macros Display section. Here the Macros of Calories, Protein, Carbs, Fats, Sugar, and Sodium are displayed as text all with a bar under them. To the right of each is also a number formatted like 0/#. For example calories is 0/2500. Whenever these macros get tracked these numbers (the 0) increase and the progress bars fill up. If the user has tracked 1250 calories, the number to the right of calories will be 1250/2500 and the bar under will be filled up halfway. If 40 grams of protein are tracked for the day and the number to the right of protein is 40/160, then the bar under protein should be 25% filled. The colors for each bar are calories - green, protein - red, carbs - blue, fats - yellow, sugar - purple, sodium - orange. Under all of this, centered, but still in this section is the “Edit Macro Goals” button. When the user clicks this it takes them to a new screen where they can edit the goal number each macro. The app will come with the default goals calories - 2500, protein - 150, carbs - 400, fat - 100, sugar - 80, sodium - 2000. The user can edit this values in this screen. So if the user edits the calorie goal to 1800, the number in this section will say 0/1800 instead of 0/2500, if they have not tracked anything for the day. ALL of the TRACKED values in this section should reset to ZERO at the start of every day. So if they had 1500/1800 for example, and then it hits midnight, then it should change to 0/1800, their tracked number goes to zero, but the goal number stays the same, for every macro. This is because they need to track new calories each day.

The last thing at the bottom of this tab is the Meals Progress Graph. This graph functions VERY similarly to the graphs in the home tab. The Right Drop down options (7 Days, 30 Days, 90 Days, 180 Days, 360 Days) AND X-AXIS are the EXACT SAME as the other graphs that I already explained. The Y axis actually functions the same too, we want the average numbers for the selected time interval. But now the options for the Y-axis are “Calories”, “Protein”, “Carbs”, “Fats”, “Sugar”, and “Sodium”. The Y axis functions the EXACT same as the Y axis from the other graphs except now it is pulling data from the users logged MACROS and displaying the selected MACRO number on the graph for each time interval. I can get into more detail, but it’s literally just the other graph from the home tab, except displaying different data pulled from a different place, the logged macros.



Backend Features that I didn’t explicitly mention but of course need to be here:

Ok, obviously we need to add ALL of the users logged macros into a database that then we can display back to them in an instant via the meals graph. We also need to keep all of their meal data so they can go back and see any previous day's diet. Also we need to be ready and able to connect a food API when I’m ready. Also, I didn’t mention this above, but the searches for food items NEEDS TO BE FLUFFY so the user can find the food option they are looking for even if they spell it a little wrong, or make it uppercase vs. lowercase, or any small text inconveniences like that.

Context I Added but we have not Built Yet:

The first thing is the back arrow button on the camera page when the user presses “Scan Barcode”. We do NOT have a good food API right now, so that is something we will have to set up and connect. We have to build that ENTIRE Meals Tab Date changing feature, we need to build the frontend and backend for that.




SECTION 5: THE HISTORY TAB:

This is the FORTH Tab on the Middle Right of the Tabs row on the bottom of the screen. There are some different screens and a few sections. This tab does NOT change with sport modes and ALWAYS stays the same.

At the top of this tab is a text box that shows the words “Search for a workout”. Here the user can search for a workout that they have SAVED. This search should lower the options based on the more the user types. If they user types “S” maybe the options of “Skating Workout” and “Shooting Workout” will be left, as they hypothetically are the only workouts they user has logged so far that start with “S”. Once the user types “Sk”, then only the skating workout should be displayed. Hopefully that makes sense. The more specific the search, the more specific the displayed options, so the user can find the workout they are looking for super quick. If there is no text in the search, then all of the users workouts will be displayed each as its own box. The most recent workouts will be at the top, and the user can scroll down this page to see their least recent workouts. Each workout box has the Date the workout was saved, like “11/14/25” for example, then the Workout name next to the date, then on the right of the box an Icon for whatever sport mode the workout was logged in. So if the workout was logged in baseball mode, there would be a baseball icon on the right of this workout box. And below this box will be the next most recent workout, if the user has logged and saved more than one workout.

These workout boxes should be clickable. When a user clicks a workout, they should be taken to a new screen where they can view all of the exercises and sets in that workout. They can’t edit anything in that workout, but they can view all of the numbers they input and all of their exercises and stuff that they logged. There should also be a back button arrow so they can go back to the main History Tab screen.

Next to the search workout bar, is going to be a drop down menu. This drop down will have three options, “Workouts”, “Practices” and “Games”. Of course here I have been describing this tab when “Workouts” is selected, and that is the starting default. When “Practices” is selected it is very similar to when “Workouts” is selected. Now on display are boxes that are each a Logged (saved) PRACTICE that a user logged in the home tab. Each practice box shows the Date and the Icon from which mode it was logged in on the right. and that’s it (because practices don’t have names, so no title). The user should be able to scroll to the page of all of their practices just like when “Workouts” is selected this page is scrollable. When a user clicks on a Practice, they are able to see the exact screen they filled out when they SAVED that practice in the home tab. Again, they can’t edit anything, but they can view exactly what they typed about this particular practice on that date. When “Games” is selected in the drop down menu, all of the SAVED Games that they user logged in the Home Tab, will be displayed. They can again scroll through all of their boxes of their games if there is a lot logged and therefore on display. Each game box will show the Date on the left, the result chosen (Win, Loss, or Tie) and then the Sport Icon for whichever sport mode this game was logged in. When a box is clicked, similar to when “Practice” is selected in the drop down, the user can see exactly what they typed for that game in the same format they typed it in in the home tab. They can’t edit anything, but they can view what they wrote, like their notes and stats. (I have not built this “Game” or “Practice” tab changing feature yet, I just have the “Workout” option in this tab right now.

The final thing is this Tab has 2 boxes at the bottom of the tab that are sticky, so even when the user scrolls through their workouts, games, or practices, then these stay on the bottom of the screen. When this tab has “Workouts” selected these left box is “Total Workouts” and the right box is “Workout Streak”. Obviously I want these to display the total number of workouts the user has logged for the left box and then the number of days in a row the user has logged a workout, for the right box. You can add a limit to how high these numbers can go, so that the number doesn’t get to big to display in these boxes maybe 999 is a good number to stop increasing these values. So the user should be able to log more than 1000 workouts, but once they log more than 999 workouts, the number doesn’t update.

For when this tab has “Practice” selected, these boxes are “Total Practices" on the left, and “Practice Streak” in the right box. Of course the left box has the number of total practices logged, and the right box has the number of days in a row that the user has logged a practice.

When this tab has “Games” selected the boxes should be “Total Games” for the left box and “Win Streak” for the right box. Of course the left box has the number of total games logged and the right box has the number of total games in a row that the “Win” button has been selected.



Backend Features that I didn’t explicitly mention but of course need to be here:

We need all things logged in places like the home or workout tabs to be able to be displayed here. We need specific things logged to come up when the user clicks on specific buttons to see what they logged. And we need the smart search option thing. There may be more that I detailed above, this tab is pretty simple in terms of backend features, we just need ALL user data for these categories of data to be saved and then viewable here.

Context I Added but we have not Built Yet:

We need to move this tab into the 4th tab spot, because right now it is 5th. Also it is currently named “workout-history” but I want to change the name to “History”. Also the current tab icon is a triangle, but I want to make it an Hourglass. I have not built ANYTHING, frontend or backend, for when “Practices” or “Games” is selected that changes to the tab that I described. Also the current drop down has all of the sport modes, but we need to change that to “Workouts”, “Practices” and “Games” in the drop down menu. Again, nothing for anything other than “Workouts” has been built yet, but it should follow the same design. And of course none of the backend for this data collection and display is built yet.




SECTION 6: THE PROFILE TAB:

This is the FIFTH TAB and the farthest right on the tab bar on the bottom row. This tab does NOT change based on the mode the app is in, so it ALWAYS stays the same. This tab has quite a few sections and a few screens.

The first thing below the heading is the Profile Picture. It starts out as a blank circle with a plus sign, and when clicked the user is taken to their camera roll. When the user selects a photo from their camera roll they can crop and change the position of the photo, then they can save and now that photo is displayed as their profile picture.

To the right of this is the user display name in big bold white letters. Below that is the user’s real account username in smaller letters. The display name and username are both chosen in the sign up. The username has to be unique to each user, to make everything easier for us, while the display name can be whatever the user wants. So if a username is taken, nobody else can use it.

The next section is the user's Bio. It has the heading “Bio” and below is the text that the user chooses to put in their bio.

The next section has “Followers”, “Following” and “Highlights”, and numbers under each of these words. This number under “Followers” of course responds to the user's number of followers. Same thing with “Following”. The number under “Highlights” is just the number of highlights (videos) that the user has uploaded onto their profile, which we will get into later. 

The next things in this tab are the “Edit Profile” and “Add Highlights” buttons. If the user clicks “Edit Profile” they are taken to a new screen where there are text boxes to edit their Bio, Display Name, and Username. Then they can click the “Save” button on this screen to save their changes, and they will be taken back to the main profile tab screen. 

The next section is the “Highlights” section. When the user clicks “Add Highlights” they are taken to the Videos in their camera roll. Here they can select as many videos as they want to add to their highlights. Once they have selected the videos they can add the videos to their profile. Once the videos are added there is a an area under the “Highlights” mini heading that shows a little snippet of the most recent video added, without sound. When this area of videos is clicked the user’s whole screen becomes the video. The user can SCROLL through all of the videos on the profile from most recently added to least recently added until they scroll to the bottom and there are no more highlights. The “Highlights” NUMBER corresponds to the amount of different videos uploaded on a profile. There is also a back arrow to go back to the main tab, and a Trash Can button when a user is viewing their own highlights. If they press the trash can button the highlight video they are watching when they press it will get deleted from their highlight catalog.

Below that is going to be the “Find Friends and Creators” button. When clicked this button takes the user to a new screen where there is a search bar at the top and then the rest of the page is just other users accounts. The users accounts on this user's screen should be a mix of the most followed users on the app, and the users that have common followers and following with this user (this user is the one whose screen we are using as an example). Essentially when this button is pressed the user should be able to scroll through users that have similar followers and following as them, and the most followed users on the app. Each “user” on this screen has a row with their display name and profile picture, and then the next row is another user with their display name and profile picture. I want this to look a lot like instagrams followers and following sections if you know what that looks like. On a similar note, down below I will explain a whole thing about “Creators” on this app, but for now just know that some accounts (very few) will be “Creator” accounts and I want those accounts to have a golden glowing circle around their profile picture. I know it would be hard to code certain users in as creators, so below in section 8 I will get into my creator idea and we’ll see what we can do about this golden glowing circle for certain accounts.

Again, you’ll need more context on the whole creator thing, so use the information in section 8 when using this section for the roadmap. If a user is looking at a “Creator Account” then at the bottom of the Creator Accounts Profile I want there to be a golden colored “View Creator Workouts” button. This button should take the user to the creators Workout History, where the user can scroll through and view ALL of the Creators Workouts. When the user clicks on a specific creator workout, I want there to be a small “Copy” button at the top of each workout. If the user presses this “Copy” button they should be taken to their OWN workout tab and the exercises from the workout they copied should be now filled in, in their workout. This is so users can Exactly Copy a creator’s workout straight to their own workout tab, and then do their own workout and input their own workout. So if the user clicks on a creator workout, and this workout the creator did push ups and pull ups, if the user presses copy, then the user will be taken to his workout tab, and a workout will be started with 2 exercises boxes named “push ups” and “pull up”, because that is the exact workout they copied. The reps and weight should not be copied however, so that the user can input their own. There are some rules to this though. The user MUST have the sport mode that they are copying the workout from. So if the user is copying a workout from the creator's basketball mode, then the user has to also have basketball mode, and then they will be taken to their basketball mode workout tab. This is because every sport mode has different Exercise TYPES, so a workout done with hockey exercise Types can’t be done if the user only has basketball and workout mode. If the user tries to copy a workout from a mode that they don’t have, then just have a small comment box under the copy button say “Cannot Copy Workout because it was logged in (whatever sport the creator logged it in) Mode. When I say “(whatever sport the creator logged it in)” you know to replace that with the actual sport mode that the creator logged that workout in. One last thing, don’t add this “Copy” button to Running Mode workouts.

Backend Features that I didn’t explicitly mention but of course need to be here:

Of course we need social media backend features in place so that users can view each other's profiles and follow each other and watch each other's highlights and stuff like that. Also can you MAKE SURE there is some sort of restriction in place so that users can’t upload inappropriate content to their highlights OR Profile Picture! Maybe use something that other social media uses to make sure nothing inappropriate gets uploaded on their platforms. The app NEEDS a social media type backend to support user following and cross user profile viewing. Also the backend has to be smart enough to recommend users to other followers that have similar followers and following as them, or else people may never find their friends on the app. Also I will go into everything we need for the “Creator” thing in Section 8.

Context I Added but we have not Built Yet:

We have built a lot of the frontend I detailed. We have not built ANYTHING for the “Find Friends” section and also nothing for the Viewing Creator workouts feature either. And again, none of the backend for this tab is built. Oh but, I have not built ANY of this Find Friends and Creators stuff, Absolutely None, not frontend or backend. 




SECTION 7: THE AI TRAINER FEATURE:

(just to preface I call this thing the “AI Coach”, but I want to call it the “AI Trainer”, so when I say AI coach or trainer, I am referring to the same thing) This is a little AI Chatbot that we will call the AI Trainer. It should be just like an AI where the user can type any question and the AI Coach will respond. The thing about this AI Chatbot though, is that it should have knowledge of everything about the user's account. What I mean is, this AI Chatbot is here to help the user specifically, or else the user could just ask an AI like chatGPT questions. This AI Coach needs to have all of the knowledge of the user’s account, that way it can provide insights and answer personalized questions for the user that ChatGPT cannot. The AI Coach needs to understand what the user needs, based on their account information and data that the user has logged and then give advice through what the user needs. When I say knowledge of the users account I mean like the sports the user plays, the workouts and specific exercises they log, how many sets and reps they are doing, the users notes on their games and practices, the users stats in games, the meals and the macros the user is logging, just stuff like that. So that way if the user wants to get better, the AI Coach can not only pull from the internet ways to get better, but also offer a personalized side to improvement because the AI Coach should know what the user needs most, and how they can improve from where they are currently at, which the AI coach should also know based off of all their logs. Basically, this AI Coach should still have the knowledge of an AI, where it can answer any questions about fitness or sports improvement, but the Real value the user gets out of this, is that the AI Coach knows their workouts, diet, games, practices, and progress, so it can offer very personal insights on how its individual user can become the best athlete possible. If the user mentions new information the AI Coach should add that to its memory. Like if the user mentions that they have a leg injury for the next month, the AI Coach should take that into consideration when suggesting workout or diet tips, and should even offer up a plan and foods to eat for recovery. I want this AI Coach to be like the users Real Life own personalized trainer, but right in their pocket.

If you have any ideas of how we can make this AI Coach even better, by having it take information from more areas, or just improvement in this idea in any way with our app, then let me know

In terms of the Frontend for this, I want this coach to be a small sized circle button near the bottom left corner of the screen, which is sticky to the bottom left corner. I only want the AI Coach to be on the Home Page, and when you click the circular button, it expands to the whole screen which is now your AI Chat with the AI Coach, and then there should be a back arrow button, to collapse the AI chat back to the circle, and be back on the home screen.



Backend Features that I didn’t explicitly mention but of course need to be here:

You are going to have to integrate an entire AI chatbot that the user can have a chat with. This AI chatbot also has to be able to see ALL of the users DATA (not like personal data, just data that they have LOGGED in the app) and then be able to USE that data to HELP the user IMPROVE.

Context I Added but we have not Built Yet:

I have absolutely ZERO code built for this, so this feature needs to be integrated into the rest of our code smoothly and the code from this feature is starting from scratch.




SECTION 8: PREMIUM FEATURES:

As you know I want a Premium version of the app. This premium version will include features that are ONLY available if the user has the premium version of the app purchased. All of the premium features I am about to tell you about are ALL features I have ALREADY mentioned and detailed above in this documentation. To clarify, the features that I described above are assuming the user DOES have the premium version purchased, here I will explain what some features will not be available without the premium version, and what that will look like.

The first feature that will only be accessible with the premium version of the app purchased is the Log Game and Log Practice features. So if the user DOES have the premium version, these sections will work and look just how I described above. If the user DOESN’T have the premium version, the Log Game and Log Practice Sections with the athlete pictures should be Grayed Out with a Lock Icon over them, sort of showing that they need to be unlocked by purchasing the premium version. If the user CLICKS on one of these Log Game or Practice Sections, a Pop Up mini screen should pop up (so a new screen pops up but it doesn’t take up the entire screen) on their screen that says something like “Purchase Premium to Unlock this Feature”, with a button that takes them to a new screen where they can purchase premium by entering their payment and all of that. As for the History section where the user has the option to switch between viewing their Workout History, Practice History, and Game History, if they do not have premium then the options of “Practice” and “Game” in the drop down will have lock icons next to them, and when they are clicked nothing will happen, and there will be no mini pop up screen. Basically non premium users will only be able to see their workout history, because they can’t log games or practices. Also, when I say “Grayed Out” I mean that, you can still see everything in the section, it is just stripped of most of its color so it looks like it has not been unlocked yet.

The second feature in premium will be the entire AI Trainer feature. All you have to do is Gray Out and put a Lock Icon over the little AI circle for people who do NOT have premium. Again, if the user DOES have premium, the AI feature will work just like how I described above in Section 7. Again, if the user clicks on the AI Trainer circle without having premium, a mini screen should pop up that says “Purchase Premium to Unlock this Feature”, with a button that takes them to a new screen where they can purchase premium by entering their payment and all of that.

The third feature in premium will be the “Add Highlights” feature. This one is pretty simple, if the user does not have premium, then they cannot add highlights to their own profile, but they CAN still view highlights on other people's profiles. The “Add Highlights” button in the profile tab will be Grayed Out with a lock Icon next to it. If the user clicks this button without buying premium the mimi pop up screen will come up that says something like “Purchase Premium to Unlock this Feature”, with a button that takes them to a new screen where they can purchase premium by entering their payment and all of that.

The 4th premium feature is the meals progress graph. This section again, will just be Grayed Out with a Lock Icon if the user doesn’t have premium. And yes, when pressed this section will make the same pop up screen as the rest of the features.

The 5th premium feature is the “View Creator Workouts” features. I already detailed the feature where the user can click the “View Creator Workouts” button on a Creators profile. Well if the user does NOT have premium then that button needs to be Grayed Out with a lock icon over it. Also yes, clicking this WITHOUT having premium will bring up the same pop up mimi screen and process to payment. If the user DOES have premium then the feature will work just like how I described in Section 6.

Here is the 6th and final premium feature (for now). As you know without the premium version the user can ONLY select two sport modes to have access to and Log workouts with. Well if the user gets the premium version, then there will be a section in the Settings (which I detail in Section 10) where the user can “Add More Sports”. If the user does NOT have premium then just add a lock next to the “Add More Sports” section in settings, but don’t add a gray out and don’t add the mini pop up screen for this one.



Backend Features that I didn’t explicitly mention but of course need to be here:

You are going to have to build the app so that some features are available with a certain version of the app. The app needs to be able to adjust the accessibility to these features in an instant with one purchase.  

Context I Added but we have not Built Yet:

I have not set up ANY system for premium vs. no premium. Luckily I have built the frontend for some of these features. I have NOT even built the frontend for the AI Trainer, Viewing Creator Workouts, or anything in Settings.




SECTION 9: CREATORS

In this section I won’t be so much describing a physical thing in the app, but rather a promotional thing that I think will really help the app benefit, and a lot of aspects of this idea will need code in the app.

My grand plan for this app is to get small creators on it. When I say “Creators” I mean small influencers from instagram and tik tok. These influencers of course post content about their sport, and they actually post about sports training, which is perfect for this app. To incentivise these creators to join and promote the app I obviously have to give them something in return. So my plan was to add a place in SETTINGS where any user can type a specific CODE in and that would make their account a CREATOR account. A creator account would come with a Gold Glowing Circle around their profile picture, the “View Creator Workouts” button that lets users actually view their logged workouts, and FREE premium benefits for life.

So first of all, can I even Create these codes that I can then text to these influencers that would give them the benefits that would incentivise them to promote my app?

ALSO, another idea I had for there to be a code section in the app SIGN UP, and each influencer would have their own SIGN UP code. And if a user bought premium with influencers sign up code then that user would get 25% off of premium for a MONTH (then they have to pay full price for every month after). And ALSO the creator would get 10% of the money from the users that signed up with THEIR Code, which would make the creators want to promote this app so much. So if this is POSSIBLE, then it is a win win. Also I can give the 10% of the money to the creator, you don’t have to code that transaction.

Just to wrap this section together we would need all of these variants of the app:

User’s App without Premium Features
User’s App With Premium Features
User’s App with Creator Benefits (unlocked through a code in settings)
User’s App with 25% off on Premium Features for 1 month (unlocked by buying premium with creator code in sign up)

The thing is, a lot of this is depending on CODES. Like if I recruit a new influencer, I have to CREATE a new code for them, so new users can use this new influencers code and get the 25% off discount. I need to be able to CREATE CODES myself and then put them into the app so that they actually work for the purpose they are there for if that makes sense.

Are all of these different variants of apps depending on the user possible?



Backend Features that I didn’t explicitly mention but of course need to be here:

You would need to make sure that a user can switch between any kind of state of the app, like no premium, to creator, or no premium to premium, 25% off for a month to regular premium, ect. There are going to be a lot of different PLANS the users are on with this idea. Also these CODES are a big thing, we need a way where I can CREATE a code and then add it to the APP code so that it actually works for its purpose.

Context I Added but we have not Built Yet:

Let’s just say, NONE of things are built frontend or backend. 




SECTION 10: SETTINGS

To be completely honest, I am not exactly sure what we need to put in settings, but I know we need it. Every app that I have ever used has settings so I know we need it to. I am assuming this is the place where users should be able to change all of their account information and maybe payment information and stuff like that. This section is going to be big on YOU to find what every app absolutely needs in settings, add that to the roadmap, and find things that our app specifically will need in settings now that you know EVERYTHING about our app.



Backend Features that I didn’t explicitly mention but of course need to be here:

Anything we’ll need for settings

Context I Added but we have not Built Yet:

I have not built anything, frontend or backend for settings.

CONCLUSION

Ok ChatGPT, you made it to the end. You now know almost EVERY single detail of the vision I have for this app. Again, I told you at the end of each section what I do NOT have built, so in my roadmap there is no need to include anything that you know I already DO have in my app. Like I said earlier, this documentation isn’t perfect. I didn’t cover absolutely every detail about things but what I did do is give you the general idea of everything in great detail. I gave you enough information to where if you do find a small gap over something I didn’t mention that the app NEEDS then you should be able to fill it in with your great knowledge. 

Something very important that you need to know is that I am giving this Roadmap to CURSOR AI. Cursor AI can literally SEE and EDIT all of my code. So make sure you know that when making this. Don’t have cursor start the app from scratch or anything like that or provide unnecessary steps, because they can see my ALL of my code. Make sure to go into these roadmap steps in GREAT DETAIL so cursor knows EXACTLY what to do. I put a lot of effort into this documentation so I expect great effort back on this roadmap. Cursor should have very minimal questions because you need to provide it EVERY single DETAIL on what to do to achieve these documentations. ALSO remember that I have built a LOT of what is in these documentations, so make SURE it is CLEAR to cursor to only build stuff that I do NOT already have, and they can see my code so it shouldn’t be a problem. But that is why you need to be clear and detailed so that cursor doesn’t build what I already have because a lot of this documentation contains what I already have, since this is a documentation of the ENTIRE app and I have of course built some of the app. In this roadmap for cursor I need you to break it down into STEPS and in each step I want you to give the details to cursor in CODE FORM AND in PLAIN ENGLISH. So you are telling cursor what to do for each step in coding terms and in plain english all ACCORDING to my documentations. Finally, make SURE cursor knows that we need to do a functionality check very FREQUENTLY, probably after each step, to make SURE that step is working, make sure you also implement that into the Roadmap.

Ok, thank you so much for helping me. Good luck with this, and as always, TAKE YOUR TIME, seriously. I am going to give you a Deep Research Token so you can really cover EVERY DETAIL of my documentations. Thank you!

This file will serve as the master reference for all app features, requirements, and specifications.
